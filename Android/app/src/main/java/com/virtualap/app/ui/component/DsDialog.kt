/**
 * The shell every dialog sits in, and the layout inside it.
 *
 * The shell exists because the width had drifted five ways. It owns the layout
 * because the height was worse: a Column measures its unweighted children in
 * order against the space that is left, so a dialog whose actions sat below a
 * scrolling list handed that list the whole budget and measured its own buttons
 * with the remainder. On a tall screen that was 48.dp and looked fine. Rotate to
 * landscape and the same dialog squeezed its buttons to a sliver, or lost them.
 *
 * So [footer] is not part of [content]. It is unweighted and comes second in the
 * source, which means it is measured FIRST, at its natural height, always. The
 * body takes what is left and scrolls. That holds at any window size, in any
 * rotation, with the keyboard up.
 *
 * Callers therefore do not set a width, their own padding, or their own scroll.
 * Pass [scrollableContent] = false when the body is a LazyColumn, which cannot
 * live inside a scrolling parent: give the list `Modifier.weight(1f)` instead,
 * the body is already bounded. [modifier] is for what is genuinely per-dialog,
 * `imePadding()`, a `fillMaxHeight` fraction, or a `heightIn` cap. Never pass
 * `wrapContentHeight()`, the shell already wraps. [borderColor] outlines
 * destructive dialogs in error.
